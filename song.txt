Hi, hi! we're your weather girls
Ah-huh
And have we got news for you
You better listen!
Get ready, all you lonely girls
And leave those umbrellas at home.
Alright!
Humidity is rising, barometer's getting low
According to all sources, the street's the place to go
Cause tonight for the first time
Just about half-past ten
For the first time in history
It's gonna start raining men.
